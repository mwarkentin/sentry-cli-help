sentry-cli-react-native-xcode 
Upload react-native projects in a Xcode build step.

USAGE:
    sentry-cli react-native xcode [OPTIONS] [BUILD_SCRIPT] [-- <ARGS>...]

OPTIONS:
        --allow-fetch               Enable sourcemap fetching from the packager.
                                    If this is enabled the react native packager needs to run and
                                    sourcemaps are downloade from it if the simulator platform is
                                    detected.
        --dist <DISTRIBUTION>...    The names of the distributions to publish. Can be supplied
                                    multiple times.
        --fetch-from <URL>          Set the URL to fetch sourcemaps from.
                                    The default is http://127.0.0.1:8081/, where the react-native
                                    packager runs by default.
    -f, --force                     Force the script to run, even in debug configuration.
                                    This rarely does what you want because the default build script
                                    does not actually produce any information that the sentry build
                                    tool could pick up on.
        --force-foreground          Wait for the process to finish.
                                    By default part of the build process will when triggered from
                                    Xcode detach and continue in the background.  When an error
                                    happens, a dialog is shown.  If this parameter is passed, Xcode
                                    will wait for the process to finish before the build finishes
                                    and output will be shown in the Xcode build output.
    -h, --help                      Prints help information
        --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>     Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug,
                                    info, warn, error]
    -o, --org <ORG>                 The organization slug
    -p, --project <PROJECT>         The project slug
    -V, --version                   Prints version information
        --wait                      Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files.

ARGS:
    <BUILD_SCRIPT>    Optional path to the build script.
                      This is the path to the `react-native-xcode.sh` script you want to use.
                      By default the bundled build script is used.
    <ARGS>...         Optional arguments to pass to the build script.
