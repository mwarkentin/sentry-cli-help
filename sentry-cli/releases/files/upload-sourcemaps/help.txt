sentry-cli-releases-files-upload-sourcemaps 
Upload sourcemaps for a release.

USAGE:
    sentry-cli releases files <VERSION> upload-sourcemaps [OPTIONS] <PATHS>...

OPTIONS:
        --bundle <BUNDLE>
            Path to the application bundle (indexed, file, or regular)

        --bundle-sourcemap <BUNDLE_SOURCEMAP>    Path to the bundle sourcemap
    -d, --dist <DISTRIBUTION>
            Optional distribution identifier for the sourcemaps.

    -x, --ext <EXT>...
            Set the file extensions that are considered for upload. This overrides the default
            extensions. To add an extension, all default extensions must be repeated. Specify once
            per extension.
            Defaults to: `--ext=js --ext=map --ext=jsbundle --ext=bundle`
    -h, --help                                   Prints help information
    -i, --ignore <IGNORE>...
            Ignores all files and folders matching the given glob

    -I, --ignore-file <IGNORE_FILE>
            Ignore all files and folders specified in the given ignore file, e.g. .gitignore.

        --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
            Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]

        --no-rewrite
            Disables rewriting of matching sourcemaps. By default the tool will rewrite sources, so
            that indexed maps are flattened and missing sources are inlined if possible.
            This fundamentally changes the upload process to be based on sourcemaps and minified
            files exclusively and comes in handy for setups like react-native that generate
            sourcemaps that would otherwise not work for sentry.
        --no-sourcemap-reference
            Disable emitting of automatic sourcemap references.
            By default the tool will store a 'Sourcemap' header with minified files so that
            sourcemaps are located automatically if the tool can detect a link. If this causes
            issues it can be disabled.
        --strip-common-prefix
            Similar to --strip-prefix but strips the most common prefix on all sources references.

        --strip-prefix <PREFIX>...
            Strips the given prefix from all sources references inside the upload sourcemaps (paths
            used within the sourcemap content, to map minified code to it's original source). Only
            sources that start with the given prefix will be stripped.
            This will not modify the uploaded sources paths. To do that, point the upload or upload-
            sourcemaps command to a more precise directory instead.
    -u, --url-prefix <PREFIX>                    The URL prefix to prepend to all filenames.
        --url-suffix <SUFFIX>                    The URL suffix to append to all filenames.
        --validate                               Enable basic sourcemap validation.
    -V, --version                                Prints version information
        --wait
            Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files.


ARGS:
    <PATHS>...    The files to upload.
