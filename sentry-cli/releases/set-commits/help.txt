sentry-cli-releases-set-commits 
Set commits of a release.

USAGE:
    sentry-cli releases set-commits [OPTIONS] <VERSION>

OPTIONS:
        --auto
            Enable completely automated commit management.
            This requires that the command is run from within a git repository.  sentry-cli will
            then automatically find remotely configured repositories and discover commits.
        --clear                            Clear all current commits from the release.
    -c, --commit <SPEC>...
            Defines a single commit for a repo as identified by the repo name in the remote Sentry
            config. If no commit has been specified sentry-cli will attempt to auto discover that
            repository in the local git repo and then use the HEAD commit.  This will either use the
            current git repository or attempt to auto discover a submodule with a compatible URL.
            
            The value can be provided as `REPO` in which case sentry-cli will auto-discover the
            commit based on reachable repositories. Alternatively it can be provided as `REPO#PATH`
            in which case the current commit of the repository at the given PATH is assumed.  To
            override the revision `@REV` can be appended which will force the revision to a certain
            value.
    -h, --help                             Prints help information
        --ignore-empty
            When the flag is set, command will not fail and just exit silently if no new commits for
            a given release have been found.
        --ignore-missing
            When the flag is set and the previous release commit was not found in the repository,
            will create a release with the default commits count (or the one specified with
            `--initial-depth`) instead of failing the command.
        --initial-depth <INITIAL DEPTH>
            Set the number of commits of the initial release. The default is 20.

        --local
            Set commits of a release from local git.
            This requires that the command is run from within a git repository.  sentry-cli will
            then automatically find remotely configured repositories and discover commits.
        --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
            Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]

    -o, --org <ORG>                        The organization slug
    -p, --project <PROJECT>...             The project slug.
    -V, --version                          Prints version information

ARGS:
    <VERSION>    The version of the release
